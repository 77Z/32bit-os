Jeez I hate filesystems, i've picked USTAR because why not, it seems more simple than other filesystems and it's for sure easier to understand than NTFS. USTAR Stands for Unix Standard TAR and was/is used for tapes and TARballs.

Update: I'm just going to make a filesystem that lives on your ram for right now, I'm not at the point of making a full one that writes to disk yet.
